## Just a code block, nothing gets executed...

... but there is some fancy highlighting

```{.python code-line-numbers="1|3|4-9"}
from pathlib import Path

home_path = Path.home()
if home_path.exists():
  data_path = home_path / "data"
else:
  pass
  # raise some error maybe?
```

## A code block that's actually executed at render-time

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

from pathlib import Path

print("Hello world")
```

## You can execute code without showing that you have by using #|echo: false
```{python}
#| echo: false

from pathlib import Path

print("Hello world")
```

## Citing references

- To cite references, include them in the `references.bib` BibTeX file
and then use the syntax `[@citekey]` to cite them.
- For example, our preprint of the Blackcap brain atlas [@blackcap_preprint].
- You can preview the reference entry by hovering over the citation, cool!
