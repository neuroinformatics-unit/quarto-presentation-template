name: Render presentation and publish to GitHub Pages

# Render presentation with Quarto on all merges to main, all pull requests, 
# or by manual workflow dispatch. The build job can be used as a CI check 
# that the presentation still renders successfully.
# The deploy step only runs when a release tag is pushed to the main branch 
# and actually pushes the generated html to the gh-pages branch 
# (which triggers a GitHub pages deployment).
